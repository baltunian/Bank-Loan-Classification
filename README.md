# Bank-Loan-Classification
This is a classification model to predict the likelihood of whether or not someone will take out a personal based on several factors.
Scikit-Learn's Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes Classification implementation to determine the likelihood of someone taking out a personal loan or not.
You will need the Pandas library, the NumPy library, and the Scikit-Learn library with its respective implementations.
You will also need the read in the dataset with the necessary information for creating the model, which will be provided.
For best results, it is recommended to using a random_state seed of 42 when preprocessing the data.
Jupyter Notebook will be required to run this file locally, however the code can be typed out into a .py file and run that way.
Otherwise, complete results can be viewed here.
